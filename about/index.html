                <h1 id="about-me">About Me</h1>
<p>I’m Logan, a <del>Tier-2 Tech Support Analyst</del> Linux System Administrator with a passion for cybersecurity, Linux, and solving problems, whether they’re digital or physical. I’m currently pursuing a degree in cybersecurity at WGU, and I spend most of my free time diving into hands-on projects, learning new skills, and sharpening my technical abilities. My ultimate goal is to break into offensive security and specialize in red teaming or become a cybersecurity engineer and build and maintain various defense systems.</p>
<h2 id="what-im-into">What I’m Into</h2>
<p>I like to stay busy experimenting and building. Whether it’s capturing flags in CTF challenges, scripting various tasks with Python, or doing something hands-on like 3D printing, building gadgets, and building custom keyboards, I’m always working on something new. Linux is my go-to operating system for both personal and professional projects, and I enjoy exploring how it can be used in different ways and just really feel at home on the command line.</p>
<h2 id="recent-projects">Recent Projects</h2>
<p>Here are a few recent projects I’ve worked on:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Building my own CTF:</strong> Built and hosted my own cloud CTF platform using DigitalOcean and CTFd for my college CTF team. I also used docker-compose for easy enabling/disabling of various challenges I built or used from Vulhub.</li>
<li><strong>Proxmox Lab:</strong> Architected a multi-tier Proxmox environment using OVS and pfSense to create Production, Test, Vulnerable, and DMZ networks to replicate enterprise-like setup and experiment around with different things. This includes things like security monitoring and incedent response workflows with Security Onion, simulating attacks with Kali, securing and STIGing vulnerable machines in my DMZ, and testing Ansible playbooks or practicing skills for the RHCSA on my test network.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="first-steps">First Steps</h2>
<p>Here are the first few projects I ever did that really got my feet wet with things:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Wazuh SIEM Server:</strong> Deployed Wazuh on my home network to monitor logs and practice incident detection.</li>
<li><strong>WireGuard VPN for Minecraft:</strong> Set up a WireGuard VPN to secure connections to my Minecraft server.</li>
<li><strong>Pi-hole Ad Blocker:</strong> Configured a Pi-hole on my network to block ads and malicious domains.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="certifications">Certifications</h2>
<p>Along the way, I’ve picked up certifications..
So far, this includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>ITIL 4 Foundations</li>
<li>LPI Linux Essentials</li>
<li>CompTIA A+</li>
<li>CompTIA Network+</li>
<li>CompTIA Security+</li>
<li>CompTIA IT Operations Specialist</li>
<li>CompTIA Secure Infrastructure Specialist</li>
<li>CompTIA Linux+</li>
<li>CompTIA Systems Support Specialist</li>
<li>CompTIA Linux Network Professional</li>
</ul>
<p>In the next year I will also be getting my Project+, CySA+, PenTest+, CCSP, and SSCP as a part of my degree plan at WGU, and based on my graduation date of June 2026 which is 1.5 years ahead of my original degree plan. Another certification that interests me is the RHCSA which I study for in my spare time.</p>
<h2 id="goals-and-aspirations">Goals and Aspirations</h2>
<p>My ultimate career goal is to specialize in offensive security and red teaming. I want to be on the front lines, testing and improving security systems by thinking like an attacker. I&rsquo;m also interested in building and maintaining secure systems, particular Linux.</p>
<h2 id="outside-of-tech">Outside of Tech</h2>
<p>When I’m not working on tech projects, I’m probably in the gym. With a background as a personal trainer, fitness has always been a big part of my life. I love weightlifting and pushing myself to improve, both physically and mentally. That same drive is what fuels my passion for learning and tackling challenges in the cybersecurity space. If I&rsquo;m not in the gym I am probably playing guitar or keyboard, as music is another passion of mine.</p>
