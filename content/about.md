# About Me

Hi, I’m Logan, a Tier-2 Tech Support Analyst with a passion for cybersecurity, Linux, and solving problems—whether they’re digital or physical. I’m currently pursuing a degree in cybersecurity at WGU, and I spend most of my free time diving into hands-on projects, learning new skills, and sharpening my technical abilities. My ultimate goal is to break into offensive security and specialize in red teaming.

## What I’m Into
I like to stay busy experimenting and building. Whether it’s capturing flags in CTF challenges, scripting automation with Python, or doing something hands-on like 3D printing and building custom keyboards, I’m always working on something new. Linux is my go-to operating system for both personal and professional projects, and I enjoy exploring how it can be leveraged in different ways.

## Recent Projects
Here are a few recent projects I’ve worked on:
- **Wazuh SIEM Server:** Deployed Wazuh on my home network to monitor logs and practice incident detection.
- **WireGuard VPN for Minecraft:** Set up a WireGuard VPN to secure connections to my Minecraft server.
- **Pi-hole Ad Blocker:** Configured a Pi-hole on my network to block ads and malicious domains.


## Certifications
Along the way, I’ve picked up certifications that lay a foundation for my cybersecurity knowledge and demonstrate my commitment to the field. 
So far, (just in 2024), this includes:
- CompTIA A+
- CompTIA Network+
- CompTIA Security+
- CompTIA IT Operations Specialist
- CompTIA Secure Infrastructure Specialist

## Goals and Aspirations
My ultimate career goal is to specialize in offensive security and red teaming. I want to be on the front lines, testing and improving security systems by thinking like an attacker. I’m particularly interested in penetration testing, bug bounty hunting, and IoT security research.

## Outside of Tech
When I’m not working on tech projects, I’m probably in the gym. With a background as a personal trainer, fitness has always been a big part of my life. I love weightlifting and pushing myself to improve, both physically and mentally. That same drive is what fuels my passion for learning and tackling challenges in the cybersecurity space. If I'm not in the gym I am probably playing guitar or keyboard, as music is another passion of mine.
