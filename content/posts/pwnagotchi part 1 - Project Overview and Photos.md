## Overview
**Pwnagotchi: The Tamagotchi for WiFi Hackers**  
Pwnagotchi is a fun tool for anyone into WiFi hacking. It's like a Tamagotchi, but instead of needing food and attention, it feeds on WiFi handshakes. Running on affordable hardware like a Raspberry Pi Zero W, Pwnagotchi *passively* captures WPA/WPA2 handshakes, helping you build wordlists for cracking networks. What makes it cool is that it learns and adapts, getting smarter as it goes. Even better, it interacts with other Pwnagotchis if they cross paths, sharing knowledge and growing together.
