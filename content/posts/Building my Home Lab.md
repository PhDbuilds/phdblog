## Trial and error, and more trials and more errors...
I learned a lot setting this lab up. This was not only a technical lesson, but also a lesson on when sometimes stepping away and taking a break can be the best way to find the solution. The toughest hurdle, for sure, was the Security Onion setup. I spent no less than 15-20 hours over a weekend troubleshooting the installation and sensor configuration. It wasn't until I stepped away and rested that I finally got it to work (don't ask me how). But alas, it was a great experience overall and I cannot be happier with it at the moment. 

## Diagram (changes pending..)
Currently this is a 4 network architecture. All of the networks are connected via a `pfSense` firewall, with exception to the isolated vulnerable network. The layout is ever evolving though, so I'm sure by the time you are reading this, it's already changed..

## Why do this?
I am doing this for numerous reasons. One of the main reasons if just to learn anything I want. It's one thing logging into a HTB or THM room and trying your hand at things, and that is an excellent way to learn. But setting up your own environemtn and doing these things yourself if a whole new kind of learning experience. Here are a few ways I've leveraged my lab already:
- Learning Ansible
- Studying for my RHCSA
- Playing around with Kali
- Playing around with SO and configuring it to detect various exploits

Overall, it's been an amazing experience, and I would recommend to anyone that is interested in tech. An amazing addition to this is having a home VPN set up, so no matter where I am in the world, I always have access to my lab! 
## Future Plans
Looking ahead, I’m excited to add a local DNS server to the mix. This will boost the lab’s functionality and make it feel even more like a real-world network.
