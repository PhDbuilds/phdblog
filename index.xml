      <title>Optimizing Learning with Anki and Obsidian</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;overview&#34;&gt;Overview&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Time is definitely in short supply when you‚Äôre working full-time, going to college full-time, driving 45 minutes to work each way, and trying to keep up with your hobbies on the side. Over the years, I‚Äôve tried a bunch of different learning hacks, but nothing beats spaced-repetition flashcards for locking in knowledge. And for flashcards, Anki is hands down my favorite.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;By working Anki into my daily study routine, I‚Äôve noticed a huge boost in how fast I pick up new information and how long it actually stays in my brain. The spaced-repetition algorithm it uses is, in my opinion, top-tier. If you‚Äôre curious about finding some great learning techniques, I highly recommend reading &lt;em&gt;Ultralearning&lt;/em&gt; by Scott Young. It‚Äôs full of insights on how to optimize the way you learn. I will be adding my review soon in the&lt;code&gt;./lib&lt;/code&gt; section, so stay tuned for that.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>How I Used AI to Summarize Long-Form Podcasts into Daily Takeaways</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;overview&#34;&gt;Overview&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I love learning from educational podcasts, but there‚Äôs a constant struggle: I don‚Äôt have enough time to listen to them as often as I‚Äôd like. While driving to the mountains one day with my wife, We were listening to an Andrew Huberman episode‚Äîmy favorite show and the core inspiration behind this project‚Äîand I thought, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm gaining so many actionable insights here. It would be great if I could consume more of these, more often.‚Äù Since I can‚Äôt magically create extra hours in my day, the next best thing is to find a way to absorb the most crucial information more efficiently.. While I do believe that long-form consumption is the best way to do most things, there are times where you just really don&amp;rsquo;t have the time to do so. An example of this would be reading the Spark Notes version of a book or watching a Youtube summarization of the core concepts in a book. While this is very beneficial at times and you can still learn from it, I do not think it is a replacement for reading the actual book. I believe there is something that happens in our brain when we have to go through the whole experience of reading the book that does not take place when we just extract the main concepts from it. However, like I said, we do not always have the time to do this, hence the birth of this project.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Hello, World- My first post</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;helloworld-&#34;&gt;Hello,world üëãüèªüåé&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is going to be the place where I post all my tech projects and the things I learn along the way. When I think about how far I‚Äôve come since November of 2022, it‚Äôs surprising to realize just how much has changed. Before then, I knew almost nothing about technology. Coming from a fitness enthusiast (aka gym bro) and undergrad biology student background (premed dropout), the only exposure I had to anything technical was some very basic concepts I learned from my genetics professor, who was a bioinformatics guy. Less than 2 years ago I didn‚Äôt know what DNS stood for, I&amp;rsquo;d never heard of a VLAN or a subnet, and the idea of writing a basic for-loop might as well have been magic to me.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Art of Invisibility</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-are-the-main-takeaways-of-the-book&#34;&gt;What are the main takeaways of the book?&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In a world of everything being digitized, everything is becoming less and less private. Companies give us the illusion of privacy, but if they have our data, we can almost certainly expect they will either sell it or lose it. Apps like Gmail and other mainstream email/media sell your data and will release it if asked. There are more security-centered solutions out there but they are likely paid services.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Phoenix Project</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-are-the-main-takeaways-of-the-book&#34;&gt;What are the main takeaways of the book?&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Phoenix Project tells the story of how DevOps was born out of necessity to bridge the gap between development, operations, and the rest of the organization. Before DevOps was a thing, the book mentions how the development team would ‚Äúthrow‚Äù their work over a metaphorical wall to operations right before a deadline, leaving ops to wrestle with last-minute issues and production emergencies. This fictional book follows the story of Bill Palmer, the newly voluntold VP of IT Operations, as he navigates the necessity of DevOps within his organization, Parts Unlimited.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-are-the-main-takeaways-of-the-book&#34;&gt;What are the main takeaways of the book?&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So much of the time we are &amp;ldquo;info hoarders&amp;rdquo;, stockpiling endless amounts of well-intentioned content that only ends up increasing our own anxiety. I struggle with this a ton, and collect notes almost as if it were a hobby in of itself. I believe this is in part because it&amp;rsquo;s a form of &lt;em&gt;Pseudo-productivity&lt;/em&gt;, where I can kind of mindlessly do something without thinking too hard about it, but feel like I&amp;rsquo;m doing something useful, therefore I don&amp;rsquo;t feel guilty about doing it like I do with gaming or scrolling through Youtube. I have noticed in the past I rarely go back and review those notes or try to make connections with and distill them into something of my own. This book hits a lot on all of that.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
