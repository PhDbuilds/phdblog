      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;overview&#34;&gt;Overview&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pwnagotchi: The Tamagotchi for WiFi Hackers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Pwnagotchi is a funvtool for anyone into WiFi hacking. It&amp;rsquo;s like a Tamagotchi, but instead of needing food and attention, it feeds on WiFi handshakes. Running on affordable hardware like a Raspberry Pi Zero W, Pwnagotchi passively captures WPA/WPA2 handshakes, helping you build wordlists for cracking networks. What makes it cool is that it learns and adapts, getting smarter as it goes. Even better, it interacts with other Pwnagotchis if they cross paths, sharing knowledge and growing together. Whether you’re diving into network security or just want a unique way to level up your hacking skills, Pwnagotchi adds a playful twist to serious WiFi research.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;helloworld-&#34;&gt;Hello,world 👋🏻🌎&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is going to be the place where I post all my tech projects and the things I learn along the way. When I think about how far I’ve come since November of 2022, it’s surprising to realize just how much has changed. Before then, I knew almost nothing about technology. Coming from a fitness enthusiast (aka gym bro) and undergrad biology student background (premed dropout), the only exposure I had to anything technical was some very basic concepts I learned from my genetics professor, who was a bioinformatics guy. Less than 2 years ago I didn’t know what DNS stood for, VLANs sounded like gibberish, and the idea of writing a basic for-loop might as well have been magic to me.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I’m currently pursuing a degree in cybersecurity at WGU, and I spend most of my free time diving into hands-on projects, learning new skills, and sharpening my technical abilities. My ultimate goal is to break into offensive security and specialize in red teaming.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
