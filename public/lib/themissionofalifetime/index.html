                <h2 id="what-are-the-main-takeaways-of-the-book">What are the main takeaways of the book?</h2>
<p>This book was very intriguing and turned out to be quite different from what I expected when I picked it up at the library. The author spent time interviewing some of the &ldquo;Eagles&rdquo;, the extraordinary men who journeyed to the moon, and through their eyes, I gained a fresh perspective on what really mattered about the mission, as well as a few other valuable insights that can be applied to our lives.</p>
<p>A particularly dramatic moment in the book details the intensity of the Apollo 11 landing. As they were running out of fuel and struggling to pinpoint the perfect landing zone, Neil Armstrong’s heart rate reportedly spiked to around 150 beats per minute, however his voice over the radio seemed completely normal. This wasn’t a sign of fearlessness but a testament to his ability to stay focused under immense pressure. It illustrates a powerful truth. Bravery isn’t about not being scared, it’s about channeling that fear, staying calm, and doing everything possible to complete the mission.</p>
<p>One of the most compelling themes wasn’t about the moon at all, but rather what they discovered once they got there. It was about the view back home, a beautiful, blue, seemingly fragile ball floating in the void of space. This perspective shift is powerfully encapsulated in the &ldquo;Earth Spaceship&rdquo; analogy featured toward the end of the book.</p>
<p>Imagine that we are all passengers on a spaceship adrift in the vastness of space, with an unknown destination. We don’t know exactly where we’re headed or when we might arrive, and there’s no promise of any stops along the way. In such a scenario, one thing becomes absolutely clear: the resources on our ship are all we have, and maintaining and caring for the ship is critical to our survival. We would spare no effort in preserving it.</p>
<p>This analogy mirrors our relationship with Earth. God’s creation is beautiful and awe-inspiring, and it’s our responsibility to nurture and protect it, not to destroy it in the pursuit of greed or power. Like many young children, I once dreamed of being an astronaut, and reading this book reminded me of that wonder and the deep connection we all share with our planet and I would highly recommend to anyone, not just fellow space nerds.</p>
