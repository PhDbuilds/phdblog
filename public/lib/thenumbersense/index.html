<p><em>The Number Sense</em> popped up in Charles Fox’s <em>Computer Architecture</em> syllabus, and because computer architecture has been stretching my brain in every direction, I decided to work through all the recommended side-reads—starting here. Dehaene’s main question is the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>How does any mind—human or otherwise—come to understand quantity?</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>His answer leans heavily toward nature before nurture. Apes, rats, even newborn babies can tell “how many” without counting, thanks to an in-built <strong>Approximate Number System</strong> that lets them (and us) spot the difference between, for example, five and ten dots at a glance.</p>
<p>Yet estimation is only part of the story. We also possess a second, more exact system that handles crisp facts such as comparing <em>37 vs. 38</em> or that <em>7 × 8 = 56</em>. Functional-imaging studies show the <strong>horizontal segment of the intraparietal sulcus (hIPS)</strong> lighting up whenever we judge rough magnitude, while hard-wired multiplication facts tap the left-hemisphere language network, especially the angular gyrus, because at that level we’re rummaging through memory, not calculating from scratch (mostly).</p>
<p>Dehaene also digs into cultural attitudes toward math. In Japan, academic “smarts” are seen as something you cultivate through <strong>effort</strong>, whereas in the United States they’re too often treated as a fixed gift that you either have or don&rsquo;t have. That mindset gap really matters. Japanese children who learn on an abacus, for instance, grow up with vivid spatial anchors for numbers, allowing them to juggle larger calculations in working memory than a typical English-speaking student who learned through abstract symbols alone.</p>
<p>Neurological quirks underscore how modular our number sense can be. Split-brain patients, for example, might hold a key in the right hand, fail to name it (the left hemisphere can’t “see” the object), yet still mimic turning a lock with the left hand. This indicates that knowledge of <em>what</em> and knowledge of <em>how</em> can live in separate compartments. I find this very interesting and there are many fascinating examples and studies on similar things like this I would recommended researching and learning about if you are interested in that sort of thing.</p>
<p>For me, the book’s big comfort is its assault on the myth of the “math gene.” Struggling with numbers usually means we were matched with the wrong teaching style, not that we’re biologically disqualified. English number words (“eleven, twelve…”) are famously irregular compared with East Asian systems (“ten-one, ten-two…”), making early place-value harder to grasp. Layer a one-size-fits-all curriculum on top of that and it’s no wonder many kids develop math anxiety that trails them for life. Dehaene’s data say loud and clear: the circuitry is there, what matters is how we train it.</p>
