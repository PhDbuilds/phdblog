      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;overview&#34;&gt;Overview&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I love learning from educational podcasts, but there‚Äôs a constant struggle: I don‚Äôt have enough time to listen to them as often as I‚Äôd like. While driving to the mountains one day with my wife, We were listening to an Andrew Huberman episode‚Äîmy favorite show and the core inspiration behind this project‚Äîand I thought, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm gaining so many actionable insights here. It would be great if I could consume more of these, more often.‚Äù Since I can‚Äôt magically create extra hours in my day, the next best thing is to find a way to absorb the most crucial information more efficiently.. While I do believe that long-form consumption is the best way to do most things, there are times where you just really don&amp;rsquo;t have the time to do so. An example of this would be reading the Spark Notes version of a book or watching a Youtube summarization of the core concepts in a book. While this is very beneficial at times and you can still learn from it, I do not think it is a replacement for reading the actual book. I believe there is something that happens in our brain when we have to go through the whole experience of reading the book that does not take place when we just extract the main concepts from it. However, like I said, we do not always have the time to do this, hence the birth of this project.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Hello, World- My first post</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;helloworld-&#34;&gt;Hello,world üëãüèªüåé&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is going to be the place where I post all my tech projects and the things I learn along the way. When I think about how far I‚Äôve come since November of 2022, it‚Äôs surprising to realize just how much has changed. Before then, I knew almost nothing about technology. Coming from a fitness enthusiast (aka gym bro) and undergrad biology student background (premed dropout), the only exposure I had to anything technical was some very basic concepts I learned from my genetics professor, who was a bioinformatics guy. Less than 2 years ago I didn‚Äôt know what DNS stood for, I&amp;rsquo;d never heard of a VLAN or a subnet, and the idea of writing a basic for-loop might as well have been magic to me.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
